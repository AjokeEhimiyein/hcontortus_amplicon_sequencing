Aim: to test and validate highly muliplexed amplicon sequencing protocols in Haemonchus contortus.

Design: 
- genome-wide amplicons, spaced approximately 5 Mb along the genome
- drug specific amplicons, spaced approximately 200 kb around a peak of genetic differentiaiton identified in the XQTL analyses, for each of BZ, LEV, and IVM experiments
