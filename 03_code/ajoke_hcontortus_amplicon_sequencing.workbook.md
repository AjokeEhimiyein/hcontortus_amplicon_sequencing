# Amplicons sequencing workbook

- this is a workspace for Ajoke and Steve to interact and keep track of work undertaken to analyse amplicon seuqecing data
- 


## What we want to achieve
- Aim: to optimise the amplicon sequencing approach
- What are we workign with: Amplicon sequencing data generated by Umer Chaudrhy
- 
To discover
1. How many worms have sequencing data?
- How reads per worm?
    - Step1 - multiplex PCR per worm
    - Step2 - pool the PCR products from each worm into a single tube
        - RESULT - how good were the worms pooled? How much DNA was present
    - Q. do we need to measure the concentration of DNA to pool
    - Q. is there enough DNA to produce PCR products

2. Of the worms that have sequencing data, how many reads map to the genome
- We “expected” that all the reads map to the genome. Do they?
    - Eg. could get primer dimers that produce sequencing reads, but don’t map
- What proportion of all reads map?

3. Of the reads that map to the genome, what proportion of the reads map to where we expect them to map.
- Primers have been designed to amplify specific regions
- What proportion of reads map correctly to where we designed the primers?

4. Of the reads that map correctly, how many reads do we get per amplicon
- We hope that all amplicons are present, but we dont know this
- Are all amplicons present?
- Are the present in equal proportions?
- Have any clearly not worked, or worked too well?
